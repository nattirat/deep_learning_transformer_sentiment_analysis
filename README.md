# Deep Learning - Transformer to Analyzing Twitter Data on 4th Industrial Revolution Technologies
This project is a part of the curriculum of UE Machine Learning (Deep Learning) under Master 2 - Data Science,
Faculté des Sciences Economiques et de Gestion, Université de Strasbourg, France

# Project Objective
To use transformer pipelines to analyzing Twitter data on 4th industrial revolution technologies

# Dataset
Quoted from assignment document :
The dataset consists of tweets published by various newspapers that focus on the subject of 4th industrial revolution technologies (AI, Robot, VR, 5g, IoT). The data covers the period from 2007 to 2019.

# Tasks
The project consist of:
- Data Pre-processing 
        - Translation from European languages to English
        - Extract hashtags from the tweet texts
- Data Exploration 
- Data Analysis with Transformer Pipelines
        - **Name Entity Recognition (NER)** to identify key entities in the tweets
        - **Sentiment Analysis** to evaluate newspaper sentiment towards this technologies
        - **Zero-Shot Classification** to categorize tweets into predefined or dynamically identified topics
